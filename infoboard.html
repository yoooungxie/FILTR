                    <h6>VN Organization Aims</h6>
                    <p>This organiazation will push its participants to develop skills in developing materials and designs suitable for screen based multimedia.</p>
                    <p>Participation in this course is intended to lead to a deep understanding of the issues encountered in digital design, and in particular the impact of platform on form, structure and content.</p>
                    <p>Participants will develop their own approaches to understanding and interpreting digital design.</p>
                    <p>The project will expect its participants to keep a record of their design methods and to submit information about their approach along with their practical design work The project also aims to push designers to develop their creative and expressive voice and to challenge them to apply imaginative and conceptual ideas introduced in lecture and tutorial sessions in order to develop works of design that may end up in their professional portfolio. It also expects its participants to push themselves technically, to attempt to grasp the concepts behind design in multi format contexts and developing a sophisticated, creative response to the brief and to apply a professional approach to the subsequent development of original assets used in the project. Finally, the project aims to provide a well deﬁned brief that participants are expected to explore and respond to in imaginative, diverse and creative ways.</p>

                    <h6>Structure and Content</h6>
                    <p>The full time programme runs through two semesters and the summer “vacation” period.  </p>
                    <p>Work on the supervised dissertation project occupies the whole of the summer “vacation” period. Each semester typically includes 11 weeks of teaching, plus an “examination” period. </p>
                    <p>Note that in this programme we are not committed to avoiding all teaching during those weeks that are nominated as “examination” weeks, since our own courses have no examinations. </p>
                    <p>However, we will do our best to avoid any clashes with external option courses that students may take.  The period following the spring vacation will otherwise be dedicated to beginning work on the Final Project.</p>
